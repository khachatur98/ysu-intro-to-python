    "# Character encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Character encoding** is a system that assigns numeric values (code points) to characters in order to represent and store them in digital form. It provides a standardized way to map characters from different writing systems and languages to binary data that can be understood and processed by computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a character encoding scheme, each character is assigned a unique code point, which is typically represented as a numeric value. The most commonly used character encoding schemes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):** ASCII is a widely used encoding scheme that represents basic Latin characters (English letters, digits, punctuation marks, and control characters) using 7 bits, providing a total of 128 possible characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unicode**: Unicode is a universal character encoding standard that aims to cover all characters and scripts used in written languages worldwide. It assigns a unique code point to each character, allowing representation of a vast range of characters from different writing systems. Unicode can be implemented with different encoding schemes, such as UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, which vary in the number of bytes used to represent each code point.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - UTF-8 (8-bit Unicode Transformation Format): UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding scheme that uses 8 bits (1 to 4 bytes) to represent code points. It is backward compatible with ASCII, meaning that ASCII characters are represented using a single byte in UTF-8. It is possible to encode up to 1,114,112 characters in UTF-8. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format): UTF-16 is a variable-length encoding scheme that uses 16 bits (2 bytes) or more to represent code points. It can represent the entire Unicode character set.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - UTF-32 (32-bit Unicode Transformation Format): UTF-32 is a fixed-length encoding scheme that uses 32 bits (4 bytes) to represent each code point. It provides a straightforward mapping between code points and their binary representation but consumes more space compared to UTF-8 and UTF-16.\n",
    "\n",
    "Character encodings are crucial for correctly interpreting and displaying text in different languages and writing systems. When exchanging or storing text data, it's important to ensure that the encoding used for reading and writing the data matches to prevent data corruption or incorrect interpretation of characters. Many programming languages and text editors support specifying or detecting the character encoding of files to handle them correctly."

    "# `with` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement in Python provides a convenient way to manage resources, such as files or network connections, that need to be cleaned up or released after use. It ensures that certain operations are performed both before and after the block of code within the `with` statement. The general syntax of a `with` statement is as follows:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "with expression [as target]:\n",
    "    # code block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the `with` statement works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The expression following the `with` keyword is typically a function or an object that represents the resource being managed. It must define two special methods: `__enter__()` and `__exit__()`.\n",
    "2. The `__enter__()` method is called when the block of code within the `with` statement is entered. It sets up the resource and returns an object that will be assigned to the optional `target` variable.\n",
    "3. The `target` is an optional variable that receives the result of the `__enter__()` method. It allows you to work with the resource within the block of code.\n",
    "4. The indented code block following the `with` statement represents the actions to be performed using the resource.\n",
    "5. After the block of code is executed or if an exception occurs, the `__exit__()` method of the resource object is called. It is responsible for cleaning up the resource or handling any exceptions that occurred within the `with` block.\n",
